# CS123 Test Image Gallery

This gallery contains test images that you will find useful for making sure your projects work properly. Beginning with Filter, which is a 2D image processing project, you'll need to deal with bitmap images. When we get to ray tracing, you'll also find these images useful -- they can serve as texture maps, backgrounds, and other assets that you may want to adopt in your final project. 

## Contributing images

Make sure you have permission to distribute the image. Then, simply clone this repository, add the image(s) you'd like to share, and submit a pull request. One of the CS123 TAs will review your request and, as long as it's appropriate, we'll include it in the repository -- and in the course directory -- for CS123 students past, present, and future to enjoy :)
